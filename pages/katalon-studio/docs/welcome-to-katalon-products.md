Test Automation becomes more and more crucial to any organization and the challenge to find an affordable automation solution, simple to setup and use, and comprehensive enough to meet a variety of automation needs. To address these challenges, we initially created Katalon Studio as a viable alternative to both open-source and commercial test automation solutions. Now, we have expanded our range to a variety of tools that will assist your automation testing needs.
