Binary Statements represent expressions consist of two **operand**s (variables, strings, numbers, methods...) and an **operator** (e.g. +, -, *, <, <=, !...).

Binary statement in Manual view
-------------------------------

1.  Open a test case in **Manual** view, then navigate to **Binary Statements** from command toolbar.  
      
      
    
2.  A test step represents binary expression is added to the test case.  
      
      
    
3.  Double click on the **Input** cell to edit the binary expression.  
      
      
    
4.  Save the test case when you're done.
    
    Once a test step is added as any of the **Binary Statements**, it will **not** be allowed to change it into another keyword.
    

Binary statement in Scripting view
----------------------------------

The **Script** view of test cases allows you to programmatically define and handle binary expression easily using either Groovy or Java language. Refer to http://groovy-lang.org/operators.html for more details about using operators in Groovy.

For example:
