Record and Playback feature allows you to quickly create and run test scripts. It's highly recommended that you start with this when first using Katalon Studio.

For beginners, these features help to understand what is included in a test case and how it is executed. If you are an experienced user, these features also allow you to generate content of test cases quickly. 

Katalon Studio currently supports two types of recording test as following:

*   [Record Web Utility](/display/KD/Record+Web+Utility)
*   [Record Mobile Utility](/display/KD/Record+Mobile+Utility)
*   [Spy Web Utility](/display/KD/Spy+Web+Utility)
*   [Spy Mobile Utility](/display/KD/Spy+Mobile+Utility)
