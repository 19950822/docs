There will be cases you need to connect and execute your tests on a remote environment such as Selenium Grid, or other cloud services such as Kobiton, SauceLabs or BrowserStacks. Katalon Studio does support this remote execution.

![](../../images/katalon-studio/docs/remote-desired-capabilities/remote.png)

Please refer to some documents below as examples how to pass in desired capabilities from these providers:

1.  [Kobiton](https://docs.katalon.com/display/KD/Desired+capabilities+for+Kobiton+devices)
2.  [SauceLabs](https://docs.katalon.com/display/KD/SauceLabs+Integration)
3.  [BrowserStack](https://docs.katalon.com/display/KD/BrowserStack+Integration)

Note that this Remote option is applied for all executions which support this kind of remote execution, so you can apply them in this option as well.
