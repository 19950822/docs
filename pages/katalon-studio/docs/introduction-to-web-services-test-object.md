*   Separate Request and Response section for more advanced Web Services Testing.
*   Automatically add query parameters to REST object details based on its Request URL.
*   Support various types related to Request information.
*   Ability to format the content of Request and Response accordingly.
*   [Ability to parameterize a Web Service object (Body, Header, URL)](https://docs.katalon.com/display/KD/Parameterize+a+Web+Service+object).
