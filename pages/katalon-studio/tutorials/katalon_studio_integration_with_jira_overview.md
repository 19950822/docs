4\. In case of creating a new JIRA issue (or Sub-task), a **JIRA native submission form** will be displayed. The following is an example form for creating a new JIRA issue:

5\. Based on your preferences in [JIRA Integration settings](https://docs.katalon.com/display/KD/JIRA+Integration#JIRAIntegration-Configuration), the **Summary**, **Screenshots**, **Logs, Reporter, and Description** of test cases will be populated and attached accordingly. Once done, click on the **Create** button at bottom of the form.

6\. A created **JIRA issue** will have its **ID** recorded in the **Linked JIRA issues** list so that you can quickly navigate there from Katalon Studio. You can also edit linked JIRA issue or remove the linking of the created JIRA issue.![Linked JIRA issues](../../images/katalon-studio/tutorials/katalon_studio_integration_with_jira_overview/Linked-JIRA-issues1.png)

Once clicked on **ID**, you will be taken to **JIRA issues** page accordingly as shown below
